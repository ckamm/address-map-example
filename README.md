# Address Lookup Table test

- The "register" instruction creates an address lookup table (if necessary) and adds an account to it.
- The "balance" instruction sums the token balance of all passed accounts and compares it.

The tests in test_basic check that calling the balance instruction works with the address map generated by the registrer instruction.
